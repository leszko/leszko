Continuous Delivery with Docker and Jenkins explains the advantages of combining **Jenkins** and **Docker** to improve the **continuous integration and delivery** process of app development. It starts with setting up a Docker server and configuring Jenkins on it. It then provides steps to build applications with Dockerfiles and integrate them with Jenkins using continuous delivery steps such as **continuous integration**, **automated acceptance testing**, and **configuration management**.

* Build reliable and secure applications using **Docker containers**
* Create a complete Continuous Delivery pipeline using **Docker, Jenkins, and Ansible**
* Deliver your applications directly on the **Docker Swarm** cluster
* Create more complex solutions using **multi-containers** and **database migrations**

Continuous Delivery with Docker and Jenkins, Second Edition explains the advantages of combining **Jenkins** and **Docker** to improve the **continuous integration and delivery process** of an app development. It starts with setting up a Docker server and configuring Jenkins on it. It then provides steps to build applications on Docker files and integrate them with Jenkins using continuous delivery processes such as **continuous integration**, **automated acceptance testing**, and **configuration management**.

* Build reliable and secure applications using **Docker containers**
* Create a **highly available** environment to scale a Docker servers using **Kubernetes**
* Implement **advance continuous delivery** process by parallelizing the pipeline tasks
