Continuous Delivery with Docker and Jenkins explains the advantages of combining **Jenkins** and **Docker** to improve the **continuous integration and delivery** process of app development. It starts with setting up a Docker server and configuring Jenkins on it. It then provides steps to build applications with Dockerfiles and integrate them with Jenkins using continuous delivery steps such as **continuous integration**, **automated acceptance testing**, and **configuration management**.

* Build reliable and secure applications using **Docker containers**
* Create a complete Continuous Delivery pipeline using **Docker, Jenkins, and Ansible**
* Deliver your applications directly on the **Docker Swarm** cluster
* Create more complex solutions using **multi-containers** and **database migrations**

Continuous Delivery with Docker and Jenkins, Second Edition explains the advantages of combining **Jenkins** and **Docker** to improve the **continuous integration and delivery process** of an app development. It starts with setting up a Docker server and configuring Jenkins on it. It then provides steps to build applications on Docker files and integrate them with Jenkins using continuous delivery processes such as **continuous integration**, **automated acceptance testing**, and **configuration management**.

* Build reliable and secure applications using **Docker containers**
* Create a **highly available** environment to scale a Docker servers using **Kubernetes**
* Implement **advance continuous delivery** process by parallelizing the pipeline tasks

This updated third edition of Continuous Delivery with Docker and Jenkins will explain the advantages of combining Jenkins and Docker to improve the continuous integration and delivery process of app development.

You'll start by setting up a Docker server and configuring Jenkins on it. Next, you'll discover steps for building applications and microservices on Dockerfiles and integrating them with Jenkins using continuous delivery processes such as continuous integration, automated acceptance testing, configuration management, and Infrastructure as Code. Moving ahead, you'll learn how to ensure quick application deployment with Docker containers, along with scaling Jenkins using Kubernetes. Later, you'll explore how to deploy applications using Docker images and test them with Jenkins. Toward the concluding chapters, the book will focus on missing parts of the CD pipeline, such as the environments and infrastructure, application versioning, and non-functional testing.
