How should the modern distributed computing look like? It should definitely be fast, real-time, and so easy to use that you could understand its basics in 15 minutes! In this talk Iâ€™ll introduce the idea of stream processing and present Hazelcast Jet, which is the 3rd generation Big Data processing engine built on top of the well-known and appreciated Hazelcast tool. Using a series of examples, this session will cover the topics like: Streaming, Windowing, Event Time Processing, and Handling Back Pressure.
