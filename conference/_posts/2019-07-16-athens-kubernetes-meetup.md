Hazelcast Jet is a distributed processing engine well integrated with Cloud environments (Kubernetes, AWS, OpenShift, GCP, Azure, and so on). How to use it? In this talk I'll introduce the idea of stream processing with Hazelcast Jet and give the insights of how to use it in the Cloud environments, especially Kubernetes. After this session, you'll be able to speed up any of your JVM stream-based application by distributing the computation into Kubernetes/OpenShift PODs.
