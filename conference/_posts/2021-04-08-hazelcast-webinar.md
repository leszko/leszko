Kubernetes brings new ideas on how to improve the performance of your microservices. You can use a cache or a distributed in-memory store and set them up with several differentÂ topologies: embedded, embedded distributed, client-server, cloud, sidecar, reverse proxy, and reverse-proxy sidecar.

In this session you'll see:
- A walk-through of all topologies for in-memory storage
- Sidecar pattern and its usage for in-memory computing
- The future of envoy-level caching with service mesh
