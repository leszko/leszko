In this session we will have a practical look at the Continuous Delivery process. Starting by a quick theoretical introduction to Jenkins, Docker and Spring Boot, we will then build a complete release pipeline from scratch and see how different tests (Unit, Acceptance) break the build and stop the release. In the end we will have a look at how to apply the Continuous Delivery to legacy systems, where the test automation is hard to achieve. The talk is intended for everyone who would like to automate their delivery process.
