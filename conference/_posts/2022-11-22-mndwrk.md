How well tested is your system? How do you measure it? Code coverage can give you the answer, however, can we trust our unit tests? Trust me or not, but I used to work for the investment banking industry in a big project where a lot of unit tests had no assertions (!). And yesâ€¦ the coverage was very high.

Mutation testing is a method to check the quality of your unit tests and show more reasonable code coverage reports. In this session, I will describe the idea of mutation testing and show a live example with the use of Java and the PIT Mutation Testing framework.
