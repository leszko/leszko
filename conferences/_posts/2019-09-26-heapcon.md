Everybody knows that we need a cache, but where exactly to put it? Inside your application or as a layer in front of it? In the container or outside the container? In the era of Cloud and Microservices these questions get even more complicated. In this session, Iâ€™ll present different architectural patterns for distributed caching: Embedded, Client-Server, (Kubernetes) Sidecar, and Proxy Caching.
