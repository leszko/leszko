[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes. One month ago the third major version was released and quite a few interesting changes took place. In this blog post, let me walk you through the five of them which I find the most crucial.

### 1. No Tiller

Helm finally **got rid of its server component, Tiller. Now, it's completely agentless**. Tiller was this small application running on Kubernetes that listened for Helm commands and handled the real work of setting up Kubernetes resources.

![No Tiller](/assets/images/blog/2019-12-19-helm3-five-improvements/no-tiller.jpg)

This change is definitely **the biggest improvement in Helm 3**. Why was Tiller an issue? First of all, Helm should be perceived only as a templating mechanism over Kubernetes configurations. So why the heck would you need some agent running on your server?!?

Tiller was also an issue, because **it required `cluster-admin` ClusterRole for its creation**. So, let's say you want to run your Helm application on a Kubernetes cluster started in Google Cloud Platform. You start a new GKE cluster, you want to initialize Helm with `helm init`, and boom... it fails. That happens because, by default, you don't have admin rights assigned to your `kubectl` context. Now you need to google for the magic command that assigns you admin rights and then, at this point, you already start wondering if Helm was really such a good choice.

Tiller was also an issue, because **it used different access rights than what you had configured in your `kubectl` context**. Therefore, you might have been able to create an application using Helm which you'd not be allowed to create with the use of `kubectl`. That smells like a security hole.

Luckily, when the whole Tiller is gone, **Helm is a client-only tool**. That fact has 3 important consequences:
- Helm uses the same access rights as defined in your `kubectl` context
- You don't initialize Helm with `helm init` anymore
- Release names are now scoped to the namespace

Helm 3 is what it should always be, **just a tool to perform operations on Kubernetes API**. So now, if you can do something with the pure `kubectl` command, you are also allowed to do it with `helm`.

### 2. Distributed Repositories & Helm Hub

Helm command can install charts from remote repositories. Before Helm 3, **it always used the predefined [central repository](https://github.com/helm/charts)**, but you could also add other repositories. From now on, Helm moved its **repository model from centralized to distributed**. That means 2 critical changes:
- Predefined central repository was removed
- [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/) (platform for discovering distributed chart repositories) was added to `helm search`

To understand it better, let me give you an example. Before Helm 3, if you wanted to install a Hazelcast cluster, you could execute the following command.

```nolinenumbers
$ helm2 install --name my-release stable/hazelcast
```

Now, it wouldn't work. **You cannot install anything without adding a remote repository first**. That's because **there is no longer one central and predefined repository**. In order to install a Hazelcast cluster, you need first to add its repository and then install the chart.

```nolinenumbers
$ helm3 repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast.github.io/charts/
$ helm3 repo update
$ helm3 install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast
```

The good news is that the Helm command is now able to **look for charts directly in [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/)**. For example, if you wanted to find in which repository you can find Hazelcast, you could do it by executing the following command.

```nolinenumbers
$ helm3 search hub hazelcast
```

The command above lists all distributed repositories registered in [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/) which contains "hazelcast" in the chart name.

Let me ask you an interesting question. **Is removing a central repository a progress or a regress?** There are two perspectives. The first one is what it all means for chart maintainers. For example, we maintain [Hazelcast Helm charts](https://github.com/hazelcast/charts) and each change meant propagating the same change to the central repository. This additional effort resulted in a fact that **a lot of Helm charts were not well maintained in the central repository**. The situation is similar to what we all experience with the Ubuntu/Debian package repositories. You can use the default repository, but it usually contains old package versions.

The second viewpoint is the perspective of chart's users. For them, it's actually **slightly more difficult to install a chart now**, but on the other hand, they can be sure that they **install the up-to-date chart from the main repository**.

### 3. JSON Schema Validation

Starting from Helm 3, **chart maintainer can define [JSON Schema for input values](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#schema-files)**. This is an important improvement, because so far you could put anything you wanted in `values.yaml` and the installation may have ended up with **incorrect results or some hard-to-read error messages**.

For example, let's say you'd give a string instead of a number for the `port` parameter. Then, you'd receive the following error.

```nolinenumbers
$ helm2 install --name my-release --set service.port=string-name hazelcast/hazelcast
Error: release my-release failed: Service in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Service:
v1.Service.Spec: v1.ServiceSpec.Ports: []v1.ServicePort: v1.ServicePort.Port: readUint32:
unexpected character: ï¿½, error found in #10 byte of ...|","port":"wrong-name|..., bigger
context ...|fault"},"spec":{"ports":[{"name":"hzport","port":"wrong-name","protocol":
"TCP","targetPort":"hazelca|...
```

You have to admit it's hard to analyze it and reason about the issue.

What's more, Helm 3 added by default the **validation against OpenAPI for Kubernetes objects**, which means that requests sent to Kubernetes API are checked if they are really correct. This is a great benefit, especially for chart maintainers. We already [discovered and fixed an issue we had in our Hazelcast Helm chart](https://github.com/hazelcast/charts/pull/82).

### 4. Helm Test

Helm test was slightly improved. Slightly, but it may actually encourage maintainers to write Helm tests and users to execute the `helm test` command after every chart installation. The thing is that before Helm 3, testing was somehow weird.

1. **Test was executed as a `Pod`** (as if it was supposed to be running all the time!); **now you can define it as a `Job`** (which makes much more sense)
2. **Test Pods were not automatically removed** (unless you used the magic flag `--cleanup`), so by default, without any tricks, you couldn't execute `helm test` more than once for the given release; luckily, **test resources (Pods, Jobs) are now automatically removed**

I know that, after all, you could live with the old testing style and just use Pods and always execute `helm test --cleanup`, but you have to admit, these are all nice improvements!

### 5. Command-line Syntax

Last but not least, Helm command syntax changed a little bit. From the good side, in my opinion, **all changes are for better**. From the bad side, they are **not backwards-compatible**, so now when writing steps of how to install something using Helm, you always need to explicitly mention if the given command is for Helm 2 or for Helm 3!

For example, starting with `helm install`. Now, **the release name is a mandatory parameter**, while in Helm 2 you could skip it and the name would be auto-generated. To achieve the same in Helm 3, you need to add the parameter `--generate-name`. So, the standard installation using Helm 2 looked as follows:

```nolinenumbers
$ helm2 install --name my-release hazelcast/hazelcast
```

While in Helm 3, you need to execute the following.

```nolinenumbers
$ helm3 install my-release hazelcast/hazelcast
```

The change is small, the change is for better, but the change is also non-backward compatible. 

The other very good change is that to delete your Helm release, **you don't have to add the `--purge` parameter**. Simple `helm uninstall <release-name>` deletes all related resources.

There were some more minor changes. **Some commands were renamed (and luckily aliased with old names)**, some others **were removed** (like `helm init` which is not needed anymore). You can read about all Helm command syntax changes [here](https://helm.sh/docs/faq/#cli-command-renames).

### Conclusion

Well done Helm! The version 3 brings the Helm tool to the next level. As a user I love that **Helm is now the client-only tool**. As a chart maintainer, I love **[Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/)** and the **distributed-first repository approach**. Keep on going and I hope we'll see more interesting changes in the future!
