Hazelcast loves Kubernetes. Thanks to the dedicated Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin, you can use dynamic auto-discovery. Hazelcast on Kubernetes can also run in multiple topologies: embedded, client-server, or as a sidecar. Whatâ€™s more, thanks to the Helm package manager and the dedicated Hazelcast Helm Chart, you can deploy a fully functional Hazelcast server in literary minutes. I already described it in the Hazelcast Helm Chart blog post, which covered the scenario when the client and the server were both deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster.
