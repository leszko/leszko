Hazelcast was always well integrated with all cloud environments thanks to discovery plugins like Hazelcast AWS Plugin or Hazelcast Kubernetes Plugin. With the IMDG 4.1 release, however, we went one step further in making Hazelcast as user friendly as possible. Hazelcast can now automatically discover the environment it is running in and find a suitable discovery plugin. Whatâ€™s more, we made it all extensible, so if you develop any discovery plugin by yourself, you can make your plugin auto-discoverable.
