Hazelcast IMDG is tightly integrated into the Kubernetes ecosystem thanks to the Hazelcast Kubernetes plugin. In previous blog posts, we shared how to use auto-discovery for the embedded Hazelcast and steps for scaling it up and down using native kubectl commands. In this post, weâ€™ll focus on another useful feature, Rolling Upgrade. You can apply it to your Hazelcast cluster no matter if you use client-server or embedded Hazelcast and regardless of whether you deploy using Kubernetes StatefulSet or Deployment. Everything is, as always with Hazelcast, intuitive and straightforward.
